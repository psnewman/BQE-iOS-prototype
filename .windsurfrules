- Always use the Figma MCP server and retrieve designs from Figma files when I share a link with you
- When using Figma MCP tools, utilize different depth levels to extract all necessary details
- If the data fetched from Figma is insufficient after exploring various depth levels, request additional details from me. Never fabricate or invent any information.
- Always use the most recent version of Figma MCP tools
